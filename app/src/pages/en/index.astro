				I am Jeanine Peters, a passionate childminder and qualified occupational therapist. 
				For 8 years I have been supporting families in giving their children a loving and 
				a loving and nurturing start in life. My own furnished flat in Leipzig offers 
				a warm and safe environment in which children aged 1 to 3 years can playfully 
				playfully discover the world.

				As a mother of two children, I understand the worries and wishes you have as parents. 
				parents have. That's why I attach great importance to a close and trusting 
				cooperation with you in order to offer your child the best support on his or her journey.
